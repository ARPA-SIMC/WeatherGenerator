# WeatherGenerator
A suite of programs aimed at producing temporal series based on the observational dataset. Daily data of precipitation, maximum temperature and minimum temperature are produced. Two different algorithms have been developed: 1) generation of single point weather data series. 2) generation of a spatially coherent two-dimensional data series.
Each algorithm has a specific directory including all needed dependencies. Both algorithms depend on the agrolib library.

## WG1D
...
## WG2D
The algorithm is based on the original weather generator Mulgets https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47537-multi-site-stochstic-weather-generator-mulgets
The code was first translated in C/C++
